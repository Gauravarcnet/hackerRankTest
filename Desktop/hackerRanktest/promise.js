/**
 * A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the 
 * future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved 
 * (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: 
 * fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users
*  can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.

  * __proto__ is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods.
  *  It is a property that all objects have. This is the property which is used by 
  * the JavaScript engine for inheritance. According to ECMA specifications it is
  *  supposed to be an internal property, however most vendors allow it to be accessed
  *  and modified.
  * 
  * <b>prototype</b>

prototype is a property belonging only to functions. It is used to build __proto__ 
when the function happens to be used as a constructor with the <i>new</i> keyword
